## 🔍 About the Project

**Open Quantum Data Hub** is designed to foster openness and collaboration in quantum research by enabling:

- Dataset sharing and discovery  
- Lightweight metadata curation  
- Educational annotations and teaching-ready exports

It enables reproducibility, cross-institutional reuse, and a more accessible entry point for learners and educators.

## 🎯 Key Features

- Quantum dataset registry (public or user-added)  
- Tagging and annotation system for educational value  
- Export in teaching formats (CSV, JSON, QASM)  
- API access for reproducibility workflows  
- Search by topic, gate type, algorithm, or author

---

## 🧪 Initial Delivery Scope

This repository will host the first modular delivery of the tool upon funding and development. The planned scope includes:

- Dataset loader and listing UI  
- Metadata editing and annotation features  
- Teaching export options (JSON, CSV, QASM-lite)  
- API endpoints for integration and search
