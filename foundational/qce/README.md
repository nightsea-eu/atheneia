## 🔍 About the Project

**Quantum Gate Sequence Predictor (Q-GSP)** is part of the **Atheneia** platform's foundational suite of quantum learning tools. It helps users construct valid quantum circuits by offering:

- Predictive suggestions for the next logical gate
- Explanatory overlays for reasoning and learning
- Modular architecture designed for educational and research use

This project aims to lower the barrier to quantum programming by combining visual interactivity with explainable AI.
