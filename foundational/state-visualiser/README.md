# Interactive Quantum State Visualiser for Students

**A learning tool to explore quantum state evolution**  
This project provides an open, interactive visualiser for students to simulate and observe how quantum gates affect qubit states — enriched with AI-aided explanations and visual metaphors.

## 🔍 About the Project

**State Visualiser** helps students understand how quantum states transform across steps by combining Bloch sphere views, vector representations, and pedagogical overlays. It’s designed for visual, intuitive learning.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- Step-by-step state simulation  
- Bloch sphere + vector visualisation  
- Gate-by-gate state progression  
- Local AI-assisted explanation module  
- Designed for self-learning, classrooms, and labs

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Three.js or d3.js  
- **Backend:** Optional — FastAPI if simulation is offloaded  
- **Explainability:** Lightweight rule-based explanations
