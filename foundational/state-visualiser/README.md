# Interactive Quantum State Visualiser for Students

**A learning tool to explore quantum state evolution**  
An open-source interface to simulate how quantum gates affect qubit states, with step-by-step visualisation and AI-aided explanations.

---

## 🔍 About the Project

This project helps students and educators understand how qubit states evolve by providing visual metaphors (Bloch sphere, vectors) alongside gate-by-gate tracking and explanation.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- Stepwise gate application with visual feedback  
- Bloch sphere and vector visualisation  
- Local explainability engine  
- Designed for learning, teaching, and lab exploration  
- Exportable state logs for reuse

---

## 🧪 Initial Delivery Scope

This repository will host the first modular delivery of the tool upon funding and development. The planned scope includes:

- 1–3 qubit support with simple gate sets  
- Visualisation canvas (Bloch + vector)  
- Overlay explanations for each gate  
- Lightweight simulator backend (optional)

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Three.js or D3  
- **Backend:** Optional – Python (FastAPI)  
- **Explainability:** Rule-based + visual guide
