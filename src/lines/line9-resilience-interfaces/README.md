# Resilience Interface

**A cognition-aware tool for emotional clarity, strategic self-regulation, and solo psychological navigation.**

The **Resilience Interface** helps individuals under cognitive pressure (e.g., researchers, solo developers, founders) understand what they are passing through — and design an actionable plan to overcome and thrive. It transforms lived emotional complexity into navigable insight through a trusted, private, local-first experience.

## 🔍 About the Project

This tool is designed for high-cognition individuals operating in isolation or under systemic stress. Rather than offering generic wellness advice, the Resilience Interface supports users in:

- Recognising and naming their cognitive/emotional state
- Mapping their current mental terrain using metaphor and logic
- Creating micro-strategies to regain agency
- Tracking movement and changes in state over time

It is **not a therapy substitute** or chatbot — it's a tool for psychological clarity, shaped by real survival experience.
