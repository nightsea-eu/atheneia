# Perspective Playground: Diverse Viewpoint Reasoning Enabler

An open, cognitive-support tool for mapping diverse reasoning on complex topics

This project delivers an open-source web application that helps researchers, knowledge workers, and critical thinkers explore, compare, and annotate multiple viewpoints on the same scenario. It supports better insight, clearer framing, and cognitive diversity in complex reasoning tasks.

## 🔍 About the Project

**Perspective Playground** is part of the Atheneia Platform, designed to **make reasoning diversity visible**. It enables:

- Structured mapping of different interpretations of a shared context  
- Lightweight, local-first extraction of arguments and reasoning links  
- Visual, interactive exploration of plural framings, without forcing consensus  
- Exports for reporting, research, or teaching reuse

It builds **cognitive resilience** by showing how different domains perceive and reason about the same situation in **structurally divergent ways**.

## 🎯 Key Features

- Import texts (reports, papers, articles)  
- Detect and visualise multiple viewpoints and reasoning chains  
- Graph-based interactive playground for annotations and edits  
- Export reasoning maps (JSON/PDF) for collaboration or teaching  

---

## 🧪 Initial Delivery Scope

This repository will host the first modular delivery of the tool upon funding and development. The planned scope includes:

- Document loader (TXT/PDF) and viewpoint extraction  
- Reasoning-chain mapping with manual corrections  
- Visual interface for comparing interpretations  
- Export to JSON/PDF for reuse  
- Canonical data schema for future Atheneia interoperability

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind  
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) + SQLite  
- **Storage:** Local-first JSON and SQLite persistence; optional flat-file export for interoperability  
- **Local-first:** Runs fully offline, no paid APIs or external calls
- **NLP:** Open-source argument-mining and clustering models
